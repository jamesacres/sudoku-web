DONE * Add offline mode for sudoku book and local storage puzzles and friends
DONE * Book offline mode local. When back online upload local sessions last 30 days missing online
DONE * Add offline mode for sudoku book and local storage puzzles and friends
DONE * Change daily undo limit to 5
SKIP * own numbers Different colour? Option? Yes because it wastes time trying to work out if it's a number I've entered or one that's already there.  Maybe my screen but I am finding it hard to see the difference.
DONE * Add "invite the whole team to my game" button
DONE * Invite whole team option when starting race, send to whatsapp group
DONE I was going to suggest for the racing team to make it easier to start a race with the whole team when you have selected a puzzle and you're about to start - maybe I missed something but I didn't see an invite whole team option there, and inviting individuals in the team weirdly makes me nervous  haha
* Start button clear CTA then ask how difficult, remove the social ticker.
* Check cell/grid Feature cost points on leaderboard

# Killer Sudoku

read this about killer
https://www.sudokuwiki.org/Sudoku_Creation_and_Grading.pdf Change the url so the
killer sudoku has killer in it different server session id, make it store the
initial cages and include this when calculating the id Change to a tab rather
than button so you can switch between the two make random not actually random
but instead work way through predetermined list of numbers, because we want 2
people who covert the same puzzle to get the same killer sudoku bell curve
distribution - increase cage size to 8, have one of 8 only one or zero of 1 when
clicking on a cage have a way to show a tips window of possible combinations
include common combinations when creating the killer sudoku make the colour
divider between the boxes a lot less prominant when playing killer make the cage
lines dotted and not coloured killer cage numbers overlap notes currently which
needs fixing mini preview should show cages
